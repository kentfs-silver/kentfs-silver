- 👋 Hi, I’m @kentfs-silver
- 👀 I’m interested in ...feeling safe again. My devices were hacked last year and I have not seen the world in the same way since. I want
to protect myself, and my friends and family as they do not hear me when I try to explain how vulnerable they are leaving themselves and 
ultimately myself if I were to ever need their internet services or likewise.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...everything I can find. Starting with a walmart motorola (laughable now that I know how difficult mtk can be), a kindle fire that I bricked, a broken laptop I paid $40 for, a broken chromebook I paid $30 for, and android tv box that I have (un)succefully surged, and my roommates windows desktop that I use just for instances when there is no linux file for whatever tool I'm needing.I'm using these projects to better familiarize myself with the processes and what happens when you don't fully read the processes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you want to teach me. I need direction as I lack focus and sometimes, self confidence.
- 📫 How to reach me ...my outlook email is my github name + @outlook.com.
